                                <b class="major">Collaborative Discussion 1 - The Data Collection Process</b>
				<p> The Internet of Things (IoT) is a term that describes network of interconnected physical devices which communicate and share data without the need for human intervention. The basic theory behind IoT is that devices, when connected and able to easily exchange information, can provide enhanced efficiency, accuracy and economic benefits (Ashton, 2009). The volume and variety of data generated by IoT devices presents the potential for valuable business and personal insights. However, reaping those benefits is dependent on the quality of the data, which is often plagued by inconsistencies, missing values and inaccuracies. </p>

<p> Huxley delineates that big data, especially from sources like IoT, is susceptible to noise, missing values, and discrepancies (2020). These irregularities can be caused by differing specifications on devices, network interruptions or external environmental factors. The effectiveness of the data is likely to be compromised if these issues are not mitigated against. This can in turn skew subsequent analyses and result in misguided insights (Elkhodr et al, 2021). </p>

<p> To establish the potential of IoT data, a key stage is to employ thorough data cleaning methods. The methodologies discussed by Elkhodr et al. (2021) highlight techniques that not only rectify inaccuracies but also anticipate potential sources of error in IoT deployments. This is similar to Microsoft's Azure Architecture Data Guide, which provides strategies to accommodate vast and varied data sources (Microsoft, 2023). </p>

<p> Importance should also be placed on continual assessment and refinement of cleaning methodologies, ensuring that as IoT ecosystems evolve, so too do the strategies to ensure data integrity. </p>

<p> IoT presents a huge opportunity in the realm of big data, however, the principle of 'garbage in, garbage out' applies. There should be an emphasis on rigorous data cleaning, ensuring that the vast volumes of data generated by IoT devices are accurate, complete and reliable. As prevalence of IoT technologies continues to expand, the methodologies and tools employed to maintain data quality will play a significant role in realising its potential. </p>

				<b class="major">Collaborative Discussion 2 - Comparing Compliance Laws</b>   
				    <p> The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a regulation that affects all European Union (EU) member states, as well as other countries that have access to data belonging to EU citizens. The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) is the United Kingdom's independent authority created to uphold information rights and data protection. The GDPR and the ICO prioritise both the security of personal data but their guidance varies. </p>
					<p> GDPR's view on securing personal data is articulated in Article 5(1)(f), which emphasises that personal data should be processed appropriately, protecting against things such as unlawful processing, loss or destruction by using security measures and organisational guidelines (GDPR-info.eu, n.d). This provision inherently broad, allowing application to many varied forms of data. By not outlining explicit security measures, the GDPR entrusts the data controller and processor with the discretion to determine what might be appropriate in their context, as the variety of industries to which GDPR applies is incredibly diverse (GDPR Eu, n.d). </p>
					<p> In comparison, the ICO's "Security" principle resonates with the GDPR's ethos but also incorporates specifics tailored to the UK's unique landscape. The ICO explains that personal data must be shielded against unauthorised or unlawful processing, as well as accidental incidents that could lead to loss, damage or destruction (ICO, n.d). Similar to GDPR, this principle is applicable to all forms of data. However, the ICO offers tools, resources, and guidance that cater specifically to UK organisations. The ICO functions on the ‘data protection by design and default’ value, urging organisations to recognise the inherent risks to their data and then implement appropriate countermeasures (ICO, n.d). Supplementing this approach, the ICO provides a collection of resources including self-assessment instruments, guidelines on encryption and literature on the latest capabilities such as Privacy Enhancing Technologies (ICO, 2022). </p>

				<b class="major">Web Scraping</b>   
				    <p> The first stage of conducting web scraping was understanding the HTML code that underpins a website's structure and content. After grasping these concepts, I could then use this knowledge to inspect the HTML on my chosen website to use the Python library "Beautiful Soup". This library facilitates the  web scraping process by parsing the HTML, using tags/attributes to navigate the content. The find.all() method can search for matching strings and append them to a list for subsequent printing or saving to a preferred file type. I have scraped the words "data scientist" from the Data Science Wikipedia page.    </p>
                            	<p> My code can be found here: <a href="Web Scraping-Data Scientist.py" download>Click here to download the Python script</a> </p>	
				    
				    
				<b class="major">APIs and Security Requirements</b>   
				    <p> Exploring Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) felt a natural progression from learning skills in webscraping as APIs offer more stability, efficienc and are often more in line with legal and ethical considerations. I expaned my understanding of how APIs operate and the measures needed to be protect data and devices when utlilising them. I wrote a piece of code that fetches data from one of NASA's open APIs. The data relates to the weather on Mars. I have included specifications which set the content type (JSON), check that the connection is secure (HTTPS), set the timeout to 10 seconds to mitigate indefinite processing if errors occurs and a check on any API rate limits which may be implemented by NASA.  </p>
